#RetarDB

RetarDB is a portable, dependency-less*, in memory, standalone, one executable key-value storage written in Go. It's currently a *work in progress* and therefore not yet usable for your every-day life. 

Working: 

- Compiles and Runs 
- All single (one-entry) CRUD operations
- The TCP Server mode

Not working yet: 

- Search (Fulltext key/content and REGEX)
- HTTP (REST) Server mode
- Websocket Server mode
- Securing the Database on the file system

Since this is in an early status of WIP, backwards compatibility may be broken in every release as needed.

Please feel free to contribute.
